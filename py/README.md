# Python Overview
Use the code here to develop and test the Startracker. This code was ran using Python 3.11.
First, install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, use `make_test_images.py` to create synthetic images for testing. These have been tracked, but
their creation should be reproducable.

For documentation, `sql.py` is tracked as well. It created the `star_angles` table in the sqlite3 stars database.
