# Python Overview
Use the code here to develop/test the Startracker. This code was ran using Python 3.11.
First, install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, use `create_synthetic_img.py` to create synthetic images for testing.
Passing `easy` creates the [easy](../StarryNight/Tests/Resources/img_easy.png) test image.
Passing `hard` creates the [hard](../StarryNight/Tests/Resources/img_hard.png) test image.

For documentation, `sql.py` is tracked as well. It created the `star_angles` table in the sqlite3 stars database.
